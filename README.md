# Hello ! ðŸ‘‹

Hey ! I'm Myriam Mabrouki, a Master student at Sorbonne University in the SAR (Distributed Systems and Applications) program which is focused on, critical systems, operating systems, and distributed systems. I'm passionate about critical real-time embedded systems, computer architecture, operating systems and low-level programming.

I'm also an intern at INRIA Paris in the KOPERNIC team and (I hope) a future PhD Student ! During my internship, I work on an energy consumption of embedded real-time systems using probability and statistics with a focus on memory.
